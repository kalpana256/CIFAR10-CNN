# CIFAR10-CNN
In this project, I will classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional,batchnormalization, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
